I&amp;rsquo;m definitely no stranger to trying and failing in this pursuit, having left high school Spanish and a few short-lived Duolingo attempts with not much more than &amp;ldquo;¿Donde está la biblioteca?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;La niña come arroz,&amp;rdquo; but by the end of the month we decided to team up as accountibility partners and give it one more shot.</description></item><item><title>Mentorbot 3.0</title><link>https://blair-c.github.io/mentorbot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blair-c.github.io/mentorbot/</guid><description>Built with discord.py and redis, Mentorbot is my longest running project by far, initially launched just a few months after I first began programming in 2018.

Mentorbot&amp;rsquo;s original and most popular feature is seen above, serving as a quick reference for hitboxes or other game info with a link to the full data on the Rivals Academy Library.</description></item><item><title>SteamJoin</title><link>https://blair-c.github.io/steamjoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blair-c.github.io/steamjoin/</guid><description>Built with Go, go-chi, Tailwind CSS, discord.py, and redis
SteamJoin was originally created as a supplement to Mentorbot /invite command, but now functions as a separate Discord bot and standalone service allowing users to quickly and seamlessly invite others to their Steam games.
The Problem Over the years of the game&amp;rsquo;s lifespan, the Rivals of Aether gaming community&amp;rsquo;s preferred method to organize tournament matches evolved from using Steam search, to sharing your Steam Friend ID, to finally using Steam lobby links.</description></item></channel></rss>
