This final process entails keeping a tab open of your own Steam profile, and copying the <code>Join Game</code> button to send to each new opponent, who then copy/pastes this link back into their own browser.</p><figure><img src=/steamjoin/img/old-method.png alt="Players sending lobby links back and forth for their tournament matches, dated July 2023"><figcaption><p>Chat logs of the last amateur bracket before SteamJoin was created</p></figcaption></figure><p>This came to be the standard by being the least involved process with the tools available, but we can definitely make it better.</p><h2 id=the-solution-pt-1>The Solution Pt. 1</h2><p>To improve the UX of inviting, the process should be kept entirely within Discord rather than requiring that a Steam window of the user&rsquo;s profile remain on hand. Using Discord&rsquo;s API and integrated app/bot platform stands out as the clear answer, making the process now as simple as typing <code>/invite</code> in the chat.</p><p><img src=img/discord-invite.png alt="Screenshot of /invite in use"></p><p>On first use, users first input their Steam ID or profile link, which is then stored persistently in a <a href=https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence target=_blank rel=noopener>Redis Database</a>. At the time of writing, over 750 users have linked their accounts.</p><p><img src=img/discord-register.png alt="Discord popup asking the user to link their Steam account"></p><p>If a problem is faced along the way, the user is given troubleshooting instructions.</p><p><img src=img/discord-failure.png alt="Screenshot of a couple ways Steam user settings can interfere with SteamJoin"></p><h2 id=the-glow-pt-2>The Glow Pt. 2</h2><p>Now to improve the UX of the player being invited, we need a clickable join game link rather than one that needs to be copy/pasted into a browser.</p><p>At its core, <strong>steamjoin.com</strong> simply requests and parses Steam API responses, then uses the <a href=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_browser_protocol target=_blank rel=noopener>Steam browser protocol</a> to redirect into Steam on success.</p><p><img src=img/success.png alt="Screenshot of the browser asking permission to open Steam and join game"></p><p>The same troubleshooting instructions as on Discord are displayed if a problem is faced.</p><p><img src=img/failure.png alt="Screenshot of the same common issues as before, now on steamjoin.com"></p><p><a href=https://go-chi.io target=_blank rel=noopener>go-chi</a> dynamic routing and JavaScript unify the search and redirect implementation, and a single <a href=https://pkg.go.dev/text/template target=_blank rel=noopener>Go Template</a> is styled with <a href=https://tailwindcss.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Tailwind CSS</a> before server rendering response.</p><h2 id=result>Result</h2><p>All in all, this comes together to create a much more quick and seamless user experience: We&rsquo;ve gone from players needing to Alt+Tab and copy/paste across three different programs to everything being done through Discord.</p><p>Upon its release, SteamJoin quickly became the standard for tournament and general matchmaking across the game&rsquo;s community.</p></div></article></main></body></html>
